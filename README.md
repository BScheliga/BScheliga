## Seasoned data wrangler, field scientist, passionate R user, hydrologist, data stewards 

I am a digital research specialist for the Directorate of Digital & Information Services at the University of Aberdeen (UoA). Normally, I support research groups at UoA with their IT related research needs throughout the research life cycle. This can includes providing advice and guidance, training, active research support and contributions. Currently, I work closely with the Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science.
